## [0.2.3] - 2025-06-09
### Changed
- All logging in `ercot_scraping/apis/archive_api.py` now uses print statements instead of logger for easier debugging and script output.
- DAM and SPP archive batching now strictly use the per-type limits from `FILE_LIMITS` (`DAM`: 25, `SPP`: 1000) for all batch API calls and DB inserts.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-06-09

- Removed references to deleted checkpoint files.
